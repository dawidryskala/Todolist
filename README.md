# Todolist
## Todolist which allows you to create task lists for a given topic.
Basic Todolist on localhost:3000

**To be able to open my project you need to download all resources. Then you need to 
use terminal to get into this project and enter `npm i` (to install all required
extenions ) and then `nodemon index.js` to start server. Go to `localhost:3000`
and see my project :slightly_smiling_face:**

**I published this website via Heroku and used MongoDB as the database. bottom ten links to the Todolist page
